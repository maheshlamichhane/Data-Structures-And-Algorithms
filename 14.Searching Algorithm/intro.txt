Searching Algorithms:
-> Linear Search
-> Binary Search

Linear Search :-> search element from the first position to last
-> it is suitable for unsorted array not for sorted.
Time Complexity:-> O(N)
Space Complexity:-> O(1)

Binary Search
-> Binary Search is faster than Linear Search.
-> Half of the remaining elements can be eliminated at a time,instead of 
eliminating them one by one.
-> Binary Search only works for sorted arrays.

Worst and average time complexity:-> O(logN)
best time complexity: O(1)
