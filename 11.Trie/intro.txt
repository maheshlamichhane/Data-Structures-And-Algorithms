What is a Trie?
-> A Trie is a tree-based data structure that organizes infomration in a hierarchy.

Properties:
-> it is typically used to store or search strings in a space and time efficient way.
-> Any node in trie can store non repetitive multiple characters.
-> Every node stores link of the next character of the string
-> Every node keeps track of 'end of string'.

Why we need Trie?
-> To solve many standard problems in efficient way
i. Spelling checker
ii. Auto completion

Common Operations on Trie
i. Creation of Trie
ii. Insertion in Trie
iii. Search for a String in trie
iv. Deletion from Trie


Insert a String in a Trie
case 1: A Trie is Blank
case 2: New string's prefix is common to another strings prefix
case 3: New string's prefix is already present as complete string

Search for a String in a Trie:
case 1: String does not exist in Trie
case 2: String exists in Trie
case 3: String is a prefix of another string, but it does not exis in a trie


Delete a String from Trie:->
case 1: Some other prefix of string is same as the one that we want to delete.(API,APPLE)
case 2: The string is a prefix of another string. (API,APIS)
case 3: Other stirng is a prefix of this string. (APIS,AP)
case 4: Not any node depends on this string(K)
