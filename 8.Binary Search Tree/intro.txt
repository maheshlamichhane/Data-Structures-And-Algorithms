What is a Binary Search Tree?
-> In the left subtree the value of a node is less than or equal to its parent
node's value.
-> In the right subtree the value of a node is less than its parent node's 
value.

Why Binary Search Tree?
-> It performs faster than Binary Tree when inserting and deleting nodes.
