What is a Graph?
-> Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of Edges
which connect a pair of nodes.

Graph Terminology

Vertices:-> Vertices are the nodes of the graph.
Edge:-> The edge is the line that connects pairs of vertices.
Unweighted graph:-> A graph which does not have a weight associated with any edge.
Weighted graph:-> A graph which has a weight associated with any edge.
Undirectional graph:-> In case the edges of the graph do not have a direction
associated with them.
Directed graph:-> If the edges in a graph have a direction associated with them.
Cyclic graph:-> A graph which has at least one loop.
Acyclic graph:-> A graph with no loop
Tree:-> It is a special case of directed acyclic graphs.

Graph Representation
Adjacency Matrix: an adjacency matrix is a square matrix or you can say it is
a 2D array. and the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices
are adjacent or not in the graph.

Adjancy List:-> An adjanceny list is a collection of unordered list used to
represent a graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the
graph.

Note:->
-> If a graph is complete or almost complete we should use adjancency matrix.
-> If the number of edges are few then we should use adjancency list.
