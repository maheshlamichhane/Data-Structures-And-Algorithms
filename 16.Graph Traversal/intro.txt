Graph Traversal
-> It is a process of visiting all vertices in a given graph.

Types
-> Breadth First Search
-> Depth First Search

Breadth First Search(BFS)
-> BFS is an algorithm for traversing graph data structure. it starts at some 
arbitary node of a graph and explores the neighbor nodes(which are at current
level) first, before moving the the next level neighbors.


Time Complexity:->  O(V+E)
Space Complexity:-> O(V+E)

Depth First Search(DFS):->
-> DFS is an algorithm for traversing a graph data structure
which starts selecting some arbitrary node and explores
as far as possible along each edge before backtracking.

Time Complexity:->  O(V+E)
Space Complexity:-> O(V+E)
