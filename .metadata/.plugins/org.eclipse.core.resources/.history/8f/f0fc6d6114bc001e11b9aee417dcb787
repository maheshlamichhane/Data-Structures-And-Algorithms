What is an AVL Tree?
-> An AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree(BST) where the 
difference between height of left and right sub trees cannot be more than
one for all nodes.
-> If at any time heights of left and right sub trees differe by more than
one, then  rebalancing is done to restore AVL property, this process is called
rotation.

Why do we need AVL Tree?
-> in case of inserting 10,20,30,40,50,60 node in BST then it will inserted
on the right side only because we start inserting from the minimum values so
all data are stored in the right side of node which increases the depth of
the tree which increases the time complexity for searching the node that's
why we need AVL tree. 
Search for 60
time complexity is O(N) for BST
