What is an AVL Tree?
-> An AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree(BST) where the 
difference between height of left and right sub trees cannot be more than
one for all nodes.
-> If at any time heights of left and right sub trees differe by more than
one, then  rebalancing is done to restore AVL property, this process is called
rotation.

Why do we need AVL Tree?
